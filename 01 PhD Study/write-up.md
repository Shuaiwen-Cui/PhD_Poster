In the context of Structural Health Monitoring, rapid damage detection and in-time response are of great importance to reduce downtime costs and even casualty, relying on digital infrastructure to properly function, e.g., wireless sensor network. 

For decades, the wireless sensor network suffers from limited energy supply, network latency, data pollution and missing, etc, which hinders the development of SHM.

My Ph.D. research aims to leverage the power of distributive computing and AI to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed solution is to build a distributed computing framework for SHM, which enables the real-time data processing and analysis, and the in-time response.

To fulfill the purpose, the research will be conducted in two phases and for each phase, the research will be conducted from two levels. The first phase is to conduct research related to a single sensor node and the second phase is to conduct research related to the whole network. For each phase, the research will be conducted from two levels, i.e., the hardware level and the software level.

The developed framework will help to reduce the data transmission demand while keeping the accuracy of the SHM system. As the data transmission demand is reduced, the energy consumption of the sensor node will be reduced, which will extend the lifetime of the sensor node. Also, less data to transmit means less network latency, which will enable the real-time data processing and analysis. The in-time response will be enabled by the real-time data processing and analysis.
