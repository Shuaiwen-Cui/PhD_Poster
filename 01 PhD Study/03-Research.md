## 3.2 Smart Adaptive Triggering Mechanism

### 3.2.1 Overview
[digital twin enabled feedback loop control for smart adaptive triggering mechanism in structural health monitoring]
- Feedback Loop Optimization and Control - Big Picture (Digital Twin Perspective)
- environment = excitation + physical and cyber structures + response
- (1) system = triggering mechanism
- (2) estimator = precision rstimator (CNN) + tecall rstimator (DNN)
- (3) optimizer/controller = Bayesian Optimization

### 3.2.2 Challenges & Novelties
- [x] Type I and Type II Error - F-beta Score Guided Optimization
- [x] Imbalanced Data - Event of Interest (static) + Event of Non-interest (dynamic)
- [x] Partially Observability - Training DNN for Recall estimation using varing level noises
- [x] Expensive Cost - Bayesian Optimization
- [ ] Comparison - Particle Swarm Optimization / Grid Search
