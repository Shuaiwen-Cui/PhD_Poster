## Assumptions

- Real Ground Truth
- Offline Optimization
- Balanced Dataset
- Full observability

### 1 Real Ground Truth -> Classifier Ground Truth [✅]
- [x] Retrained a model using Keras
- [x] The model was evaluated using X-Cube-AI for on PC & on target test

**Onboard AI Test - Event Classification - X-Cube-AI**
- simulation test - x86 PC C model
- onboard test - target C model

**To do in future:**
To be implemented on the target (use in applications)


**[sensor fault]**

story-telling:

**surrogate model**, functions as the DT of the real system.
- ML
- other parts

how to calibrate the surrogate model to the real system? - adaptive triggering mechanism

gain new data / update the model


### 2 Offline Optimization -> Online Optimization

- PSO: optimization on the whole dataset in one go
- RL: optimization by iterations

### 3 Balanced Dataset -> Imbalanced Dataset

RL: DQN - **Deep Q Network**

experience replay, ER
prioritized experience replay，PER

[EX](EX.png)

### 4 Full Observability -> Partial Observability

Bayesian Optimization, etc.


SATM

- 1 - [SYSTEM] Triggering Mechanism
- 2 - [EVALUATOR] CNN Model 
- 3 - [OPTIMIZER] PSO / RL
