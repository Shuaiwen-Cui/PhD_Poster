# programming
- [x] WT
- [x] ICA
  - for now the ICA can only be performed for cases where the number of raw signals is equal to the number of sources of interest.
  - can not match with PC yet, casued by the iteration process, Aditya is helping to compare the results and locate the detailed problem

# verification
- [ ] WT - rough test OK
- [ ] ICA - iteration is the key

## plan
- [ ] BLOCK BY BLOCK
- [ ] WT
- [ ] ICA
- [ ] NN

# writing
## theory
- [ ] Algorithm Introduction
- WT
  - why detailed coefficients in WT?
  - why only use level 4 detailed coefficients?


## implementation
- [ ] Implementation & Results Description

## results

to be done

# slides
- [x] formulas from Aditya
- [ ] complete slides for presentation & student competition
